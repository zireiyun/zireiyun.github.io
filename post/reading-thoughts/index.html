        <article>
            <p>I have a folder of notes which I use to record my thoughts on some book I read. Here are a collection of those notes for books I read in 2018 and 2019. Much spoilers, please skip if you intend to read. I don&rsquo;t agree with everything I wrote back then, but here they are~</p>
<h4 id="who-moved-my-cheese">Who moved my cheese</h4>
<p>Simple simple story of not overthink, feel sorry for yourself, and let emotions cloud your judgment, decisions and actions. Sometimes it is better to be like a mouse and not overthink, don&rsquo;t let your strengths hold you back. Be aware of your surroundings and don&rsquo;t be complacent or entitled.</p>
<h4 id="the-leader-the-teacher--you-leadership-through-the-third-generation">The Leader, The Teacher &amp; You: Leadership Through The Third Generation</h4>
<p>Every chapter starts with a short story, similar to the kind that is used in Chinese Comprehension passages back in school, but in English. This story left a deep impression on me. The black belt story - the teacher asks the student what is the meaning of the blackbelt? A recognition of efforts? An assurance of techniques and skills? A testament to the many years of discipline and training? No, the meaning of receiving the blackbelt is not the end, but to be your own shifu and be on a journey with no end to the highest standards beyond yourself.</p>
<p>Another story is about the water and the rock - do you want to be the rock in the stream, gradually become smooth but still by the motion of coursing waters? Or the water that meanders and finds its path no matter what and will not be held back.</p>
<p>As always, the principle is anticipate change, stay relevant.</p>
<h4 id="disrupt-yourself">Disrupt Yourself</h4>
<p>Really like this book as it changed my perspective on things.</p>
<p>S-shaped learning curve</p>
<ul>
<li>starting out is always always hard</li>
<li>the efforts suddenly pays off and competency increases quickly</li>
<li>stagnation is reached where a lot lot lot more effort is needed to reach the very pinnacle</li>
<li>recognise the stage and don&rsquo;t be too demotivated when the results are not proportionate to the effort</li>
</ul>
<p>Market risk vs Competition risk</p>
<ul>
<li>there is less risk in finding a new market (creating a product for consumers and finding the market) then competitive risk (going into an established market where long time players amassed many resources)</li>
<li>look for new opportunities, do not do what others is doing</li>
<li>eg Lawyer with social media following, creating a new product, new show, new format</li>
</ul>
<p>Pivot</p>
<ul>
<li>when necessary make the lateral change</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t be stagnant, change is good, risk is good</li>
<li>doing more, recognising how the old skills may be helpful in a new arena and learning the new competencies in the new environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a job, we are hired and get monetary conpensation for our time and effort. In fact, we are also &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; the job to fulfill our needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional: to be able to collaborate with others, to mentor and be mentored</li>
<li>intellectual: to use our expertise to solve and problem, to be in the right state where the job is challenging but doable</li>
<li>social: status from job title, being respected for skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Small part of the book just talks about how lonely it feels, how lost, no identity, no plan, no idea how to continue.</p>
<h4 id="the-secret-garden">The Secret Garden</h4>
<p>When something is neglected, it withers and dies, but when it is worked on and cared for it thrives. Take care of your garden, everyone~</p>
<h4 id="leaders-eat-last">Leaders eat Last</h4>
<p>Circle of security </p>
<ul>
<li>able to feel safe in circle, job not endangered, no backstabbing, trust and collaboration between members</li>
<li>only then can people be fully creative, innovative and give their full potential</li>
<li>being outside of this circle makes people stressed, paranoid, unable to focus on their job if they have to guard their job and guard against others</li>
<li>there are very real effects from hormones in our bodies. High amounts/ constant cortisol negatively affects our performance in the long run. Dopamine, serotonin encourages/rewards collaboration and helping others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Millennial</p>
<ul>
<li>entitled</li>
<li>coddled</li>
<li>looking for a sense of purpose in job</li>
<li>resourceful</li>
<li>need mentorship/taking care after</li>
</ul>
<p>How to run a company</p>
<ul>
<li>150 ppl is the ideal number maximally</li>
<li>open communication between decision makers and people closest to the work who have the most information</li>
<li>being a leader is not about holding all the power and feeling self important from the power, it is about letting go of this and distributing the power to the people closest to the information/ on the ground who can see and understand the best</li>
<li>Rules are meant to be broken as rules work only in a set environment. People do not trust rules, but trust people that know the appropriate time to break these rules.</li>
<li>mentorship is good, being resourceful is good, being resilient is good, it takes time to build competency</li>
<li>Be clear of the vision of the company to inspire people. Are you working to increase money? What is the product for? Who does it help? In what way does the product spark joy for others?</li>
<li>Maximising stockholder&rsquo;s value is a shitty way to run the company. Stockholders are not the owners of the company. Company should serve the needs of the community/of the consumers.</li>
<li>Be kind, be empathetic to others. If a leader, help others/employees. If employee, show concern for leaders too.</li>
<li>Leaders eat last, the main message is that leaders serve people, work not for their self interest but for the interest of other. That is the price of power.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fragile-lives">Fragile lives</h4>
<p>A book about recollections of a cardiac surgeon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Sometimes the patient dies there nothing you can do.</li>
<li>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t have the best equipment/tools but don&rsquo;t let that stop you.</li>
<li>Start from the very bottom, very humble beginnings, there is nothing beneath you, no ego.</li>
<li>Go wherever the opportunities are, be it the other side of the world.</li>
<li>Reach out to people, other&rsquo;s strengths are yours as well.</li>
<li>Sometimes the fight does not end with you. Aftercare is important, and sometimes people are too paralyzed to make good decisions and it is not your fault. Lose some win some.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t give up.</li>
<li>Being in a hospital maybe a normal occurrence for doctors/surgeons but is one of the most important moment for a patient&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>Do the right thing, don&rsquo;t take the easy way but know when to stop.</li>
<li>At the end, a lot of things are sacrificed, family, friends, person time, time spent with children, all for a job. Some things just have to give way.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="to-kill-a-mocking-bird">To Kill a Mocking Bird</h4>
<p><code>You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.</code>
compassionate, considerate</p>
<p><code>I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.</code>
brave with a bit of stupidity, and to have hope</p>
<p><code>People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.</code>
bias, try to understand from other point of view</p>
<p><code>Atticus said to Jem one day, &quot;I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.&quot; That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. &quot;Your father’s right,&quot; she said. &quot;Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”</code>
some people did nothing wrong</p>
<p><code>&quot;Atticus, he was real nice.&quot; &quot;Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.&quot;</code>
not being naive but not being cynical</p>
<p>To be courteous, dignified, stand up for what is right, be different from the crowd, even if it puts the people around you in a difficult position, even if it was handed to you without your consent. Hold on to your values. </p>
<h4 id="old-man-and-the-sea">Old Man and the Sea</h4>
<p>Dude has not caught a fish for 84 days, went on the same routine on the 85th day, hooked a huge fish and after 2 days and night, got close enough to it to stab it and killed it. Tied it to the boat and sailed back, but due to the blood of the marlin dripping into the sea, attracted waves after waves of shark. Eventually the fish was completely devoured by the sharks, and the man only brought the bones of the fish back utterly defeated.</p>
<p>The old man loves the boy who fed him and helped and accompanied him daily. </p>
<p><code>Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.</code> Don&rsquo;t skive, don&rsquo;t be complacent. Do what is right every time. If the old man was impatient and pulled when the line was taut, it may break and the fish would have gotten away. Don&rsquo;t cut corners.</p>
<p><code>“But man is not made for defeat,&quot; he said. &quot;A man can be destroyed but not defeated.”</code>
you can be devastated but not give up, not give in</p>
<p><code>Let him think that I am more man than I am and I will be so.</code>
not disappointing others</p>
<p><code>Now is no time to think of what you do not have.Think of what you can do with that there is.</code>
when the old man was on his 2 day hook of the fish, alone in the sea, guided by stars and perhaps not alone but with fish bro</p>
<p><code>Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?</code> 
sed when life is nearing the end</p>
<p><code>I may not be as stong as I think, but I know many tricks and I have resolution.</code>
trust yourself</p>
<p><code>You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?</code></p>
<h4 id="the-little-prince">The Little Prince</h4>
<p><code>And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.</code>
intangible and hard to grasp</p>
<p><code>It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.</code>
thanks to everyone that is willing to spend a precious part of their day with me</p>
<p><code>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.</code>
is it difficult to fill the heart</p>
<p><code>&quot;People have forgotten this truth,&quot; the fox said. &quot;But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose.” </code>
people come and go all the time</p>
<p><code>“You - you alone will have the stars as no one else has them...In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night...You - only you - will have stars that can laugh.”</code>
I wish I could give you everything but I have nothing</p>
<p><code>“People where you live,&quot; the little prince said, &quot;grow five thousand roses in one garden... yet they don't find what they're looking for...They don't find it,&quot; I answered. &quot;And yet what they're looking for could be found in a single rose, or a little water...&quot;</code>
don&rsquo;t be greedy</p>
<p><code>“You're beautiful, but you're empty. No one could die for you.” </code></p>
<p><code>“When someone blushes, doesn't that mean 'yes'?” </code>
nop</p>
<h4 id="ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</h4>
<p>Ikigai - finding your meaning in life, reason for existence doing some you love, you are good at, you can make money from, and contribute to society.</p>
<p>Healthy living - breathing techniques,  yoga,  tachi, moving around often, not seating.</p>
<p>Socialising - being with friends, living</p>
<p>Living in the moment - accepting your emotions, like being in a storm, don&rsquo;t try to change or reject them, observe them and know that things will change.</p>
<p>Accepting the temporary nature of life and live in the moment. Every experience is unique, special and cannot be repeated.</p>
