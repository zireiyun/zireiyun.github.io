        <article>
            <p>I wanted to write this post after watching Techlead explained The Golden Path. Everyone has a golden path which they know to follow towards their success. It could be following your parents’ instructions - study hard, get into a good school and get a respectable job. It could be following the footsteps of those we admire. It could be the goal we are woking towards.</p>
<p>Somehow, people get distracted and decide against that path. Is it because the road is too boring, too long, too winding? Is it because of the fear of failing something we so cherish that it is better to not start at all? Are there some distractions that is more enticing than what we have been pursuing for so long? The golden path is not so golden after all. It is normal, repetition day after day, it is a habit.</p>
<p>Maybe we fall off for a bit to see the world, to prove ourself, gain something just to lose it, to understand the appeal of normalcy. If I did fall, I don’t want to be the cause of my failure.</p>
