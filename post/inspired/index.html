            <p>I was recommended this book by a supervisor I had. I think of it as a farewell present from the supervisor I worked with for close to 2 years. The first 2 years of work that was not the most smooth sailing, but I have seen my growth that has not come very easily.</p>
<p>The book is kind of like a manual on how to be a product manager, with job descriptions of each member of a product team; tools, methods and processes used by the team.</p>
<p>As someone that has no plans or interest to be a product manager, this was a long read, taking about 8 months.  Overall, I am happy to have this informative read and have a little peek into the product management world and workflows in tech companies.</p>
<p>Some points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make things that people don&rsquo;t use (learnt this the hard way)</li>
<li>Have a vision for the product. Have people buy in to the vision. Convince others by looking at their perspective. Bring the necessary people at the right time. Collaborative process.</li>
<li>Start up : new product company that has yet to achieve product/market fit</li>
<li>unk unk : unknown unknows</li>
<li>Solving problems, not implement features</li>
<li>Choose the right MVP and different user research techniques</li>
<li>Holistic Product: functionality, technology, UX, monetisation, support</li>
<li>Risks : value, usability, feasibility, business viability</li>
<li>Use the right processes and techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a good manual to come back to when creating something for others to use.</p>
