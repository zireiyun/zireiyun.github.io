      <description>I have a folder of notes which I use to record my thoughts on some book I read. Here are a collection of those notes for books I read in 2018 and 2019. Much spoilers, please skip if you intend to read. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with everything I wrote back then, but here they are~
Who moved my cheese Simple simple story of not overthink, feel sorry for yourself, and let emotions cloud your judgment, decisions and actions.</description>

      <title>Golden path</title>

      <description>I wanted to write this post after watching Techlead explained The Golden Path. Everyone has a golden path which they know to follow towards their success. It could be following your parents’ instructions - study hard, get into a good school and get a respectable job. It could be following the footsteps of those we admire. It could be the goal we are woking towards.
Somehow, people get distracted and decide against that path.</description>

      <description>When starting a new phase in life, the excitement and passion is high as everything is fresh and full of possibilities. It is an unavoidable fact of life that we would face many difficulties, spend a lot of effort and become exhausted. If it is possible, I would take a screenshot in life to remember the moment where I was not so tired, not so jaded, and without the entitlement of feeling I deserve recognition.</description>
